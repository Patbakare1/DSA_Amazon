### 🧠 Insights & Recommendations

### 🔍 What I Found
- Most items in the dataset are **priced above $500**, showing that many sellers focus on high-end or expensive products.
- In total, **five categories** (including Toys & Games) have a **very low number of products**, suggesting missed opportunities.
- **Electronics** and **Home & Kitchen** have the **most products** and **the highest number of customer reviews**, meaning they’re the most active categories.
- Products with **4.0-star ratings or higher** also have the **most reviews**, showing that customers trust and like these items.
- Some products are sold with **huge discounts up to 94% off**, and on average, discounts are around **47%**.

### ✅ What I Recommend
- **Add more affordable items** to attract customers with smaller budgets.
- **Expand categories with very few products**, especially **Toys & Games** they may offer new sales opportunities.
- **Continue focusing on Electronics and Home & Kitchen**, since they’re already popular and performing well.
- **Promote the top-rated products** with many reviews, they already have customer trust and can drive more sales.
- **Review the heavy discounts** Check if the discounts are helping or hurting profits, you may not need to drop prices so much.
